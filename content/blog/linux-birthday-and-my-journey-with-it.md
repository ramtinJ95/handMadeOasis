Let me preface this coming post with the fact that
i was a huge MacOS fanboy for a decade or so and only started feeling that the
OS was getting in my way a couple of years ago.

With today being the 34th birthday of Linux it made me reflect a bit over how i
have used it over the years. I started out using Ubuntu at University 12 years
ago for some intro labs and for learning how to navigate the filesystem with a
terminal. That experience was very meh, I thought the OS looked clunky and i was
not sold on using the terminal over a GUI, especially when compared to the sleek
and beautiful MacOS UI. So this was an opinion that I held on to for a long
time, of course I was using Linux in the cloud for servers and even just running
stuff with docker and so on but that was it really.

Then around mid to late 2023, for some reason I really got into optimizing
and customizing my developer experience, but also just my interactions with my
computer. The best way I can describe it is like I started to not only think of
the computer as a tool to get things done with, but rather an extension of
myself somehow. At this point I was looking for something different, something
that would allow me to feel closer to the computer in a sense. Randomly I got
recommended (is it ever randomly though? I feel like the Youtube algorithm
somehow knows what I'm really looking for, this has happened more than once) a
clip of ThePrimeagen just absolutely flying all over the screen, editing code,
compiling, looking at the result, back to the browser, back to the code, paste
here, paste there etc. I was just amazed and decided I want that for myself so i
started learning Neovim, tmux etc. Very slowly at first but as time passed I
started to gain quite a bit of confidence with the tools.

At this point in time I was still using MacOS as my daily driver, but now I was
starting to see the problems. Just how the OS is blocking you from doing what
you want and even on the "Pro" machines you cannot really do anything they dont
want you to do. I find MacOS to be quite an opinionated OS actually, and that is
super fine, but I started to not share those same opinions anymore slowly but
surely. My frustrations really reached a tipping point when i was trying to use
a proper window manager on MacOS, i choose to go with the yabai + skhd combo and
wow is the setup brittle. It feels like on every MacOS update something new
breaks or stops working. So i thought if this is already the case, and one of
the major points against a Linux desktop environment is that it can be prone to
breaking, then I'm already in pain let me atleast have the freedom that comes
with Linux.

So I went back to Ubuntu and tried it again. It was again just okej, it was
better than the first time because i was super used to a terminal based workflow
and the tools i used for my job, Neovim, tmux, zsh, eza, zioxide, yazi etc where
the same but something was still missing. Then around a month ago I came across
an Arch Linux config package called Omarchy, from the famous programmer DHH.
