This is the introduction to a new series I'm calling "We got agents at home".
The main idea of the series is very simple, I want to share my journey of
creating a capable coding agent from scratch without using any agent framework.
But the motivation and inpiration to making it into a series and actually
commiting to going from 0 to a capable coding agent that can make use of
subagents, context pruning, custom tooling, mcp's and other table stakes
features such as /commands, custom agent definition together with a good looking
TUI is a bit less simple.
