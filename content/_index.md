# Welcome to Handmade Oasis

Hi, I'm Ramtin Javanmardi, and this is my personal corner of the internet where I share thoughts on software engineering, technology, and crafting digital experiences.

The blog's name is inspired by Handmade Hero, a project that deeply
resonates with my passion for really going under the hood and understanding the
intricacies of software development. The oasis part reflects my desire to create
a calm, focused space in the otherwise very chaotic and fast moving tech world.

This blog is built with Hugo and designed with simplicity in mind - fast loading, clean aesthetics, and a focus on content over clutter. No bloated scripts, no tracking, just pure reading experience.

## What you'll find here

Technical insights, project reflections, and explorations into the art of building software that matters.
