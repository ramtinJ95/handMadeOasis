  <p>This space is moving at a dizzying pace currently and as such there are
many new &ldquo;frameworks&rdquo;, methods and approaches popping up and promising the
world. But having spent the past 2 months trying out many of these on
non-trivial tasks I have managed to nail a workflow which I have pretty
good success rate with. This post is intended to be like a context
compaction of all the things I have explored and learned during this time.</p>
<h2 id="subagents-and-commands">Subagents and /commands</h2>
<p>I wrote about a ladder of AI proficiency in an earlier
<a href="/brain-dump-ai-assisted-workflows/">post</a> which essentially has these 4
levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1: Using a chat interface provided by one of the big model
providers</li>
<li>Level 2: Using the chat interface next to your code with something like
cursor or GitHub copilot in your editor of choice</li>
<li>Level 3: Going full agentic and letting the agent iterate a few steps
before you as the human in the loop review, course correct and provide
further prompting</li>
<li>Level 4: Having 2 or more agents work together without the involvement
of a human at every step.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have now moved up from Level 3 to Level 4 and consistently make use of
subagents in my workflow. This really boils down to a context hack more
than anything else. Having one agent orchestrate a plan where each task in
that plan is done by a subagent that then throws away that entire context
and only shows the final step to the main agent is really useful to keep
the main agent focused and on the right track. Notice here that I&rsquo;m not
talking about having one session that uses different &ldquo;kinds&rdquo; of agents,
this is about one primary agent that itself can spin up new sessions with
subagents when it deems it necessary or useful. Anthropic for example has
come to the same realization and released the new memory tools which
allows for deletion of older tool calls in the context.</p>
<p>In this category of useful hacks are /commands. Basically these are ideal
for repetitive prompts that can be used in different code bases, such as
/review or /brainstorm etc. Comparing them to the other techniques I will
mention they are probably the simplest, as they are basically stored
prompts that can be reused with some modifications. One of them is for
example that in opencode a /command can spin up a subagent or a specific
agent with access to specific tools to execute the prompt. But I mostly
use it as a way to use a carefully crafted prompt in many different
scenarios, like /review and /brainstorm.</p>
<h2 id="sdd-spec-driven-development">SDD (Spec Driven Development)</h2>
<p>This set of methodologies and tools are your spec-kit, openspec and bmad
type of approaches. The idea here is to use .md files as a way of making
it very very clear to the LLM what to do, how it should be done and
breaking everything down to small tasks that are reviewable by a human.
Usually it also involves many steps of the human actually reviewing text
in .md files before ever seeing a single line of code.</p>
<h3 id="why-sdd-didnt-work-for-me">Why SDD didn&rsquo;t work for me</h3>
<p>In their current iteration these methods and &ldquo;frameworks&rdquo; are completely
unusable when introducing them into an existing codebase, the amount of
work it would require is just not worth it at all to get slightly more
deterministic results. In general I think this whole idea is something
like UML was when it was introduced, in theory it sounds great in reality
it&rsquo;s just not working. Why would I spend all this time writing and review
text that will then be used by an ultimately random text processing engine
that will use this as input to generate some code or text? It&rsquo;s just way
faster to just iterate on the code and steer the agents and write the damn
code myself. If I had such a clear understanding of the problem that I
could write all these specs, why not just write the code at that point?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know maybe it&rsquo;s a personality thing or a workflow thing, but this
method does not make sense to me at all. To me they sell a false sense of
control. Just come to grips with the fact that LLMs as a tool are not
deterministic and move on and apply them where that is not a problem.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, yes spend some time on your prompt and try to manage
your context as much as possible but all this extra work around .md files
in multiple steps and the amount of front loading, it&rsquo;s just not the way
in my honest opinion.</p>
<p>So in conclusion this SDD approach was just painful for me and I really
did not enjoy it. Even if it was the best way to use LLM, which I don&rsquo;t
think it is, I would not use it because it&rsquo;s just so painful and boring.
But the silver lining here is that I did learn and got used to writing
good and precise prompts and markdown files with instructions.</p>
<h2 id="mcp-and-skillmd">MCP and SKILL.md</h2>
<p>This section could be an entire post but I will try to keep it as short as
possible.</p>
<p>The new Skills concept that Anthropic released a week ago is quite simple
and it&rsquo;s something that I was already moving towards because the AGENTS.md
files were eating too much context already. I had already started using
AGENTS.md as an index to where to find other markdown files with more
detail for the task at hand if that is needed. But it&rsquo;s great that this is
becoming official, because that usually means that some tooling around
these things will pop-up and that&rsquo;s a good thing. Or simply that the
models have some a priori system prompt that tells them to look for these
files and this structure out of the box.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s backup for a moment though, what is a skill and what problem does it
aim to solve? A Skill is pretty much a folder with context + optional code
ready to be run. Claude reads a 2-line description. When you need it,
Claude loads the full thing to get the extra context + get your custom
code tools ready. That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>The problem this aims to solve in my mind is context pollution. Even
though context windows are growing and probably will continue to do so, it
seems like the model&rsquo;s ability to pay attention to everything in the
context decreases the more of that window one consumes. You need to
consume as little as possible of the context window so the tool
(agent/llm) can get anything worthwhile done. And this is something that
MCPs and AGENTS.md files kind of failed at. They consume way too much
context window.</p>
<h3 id="why-im-cooling-on-mcps">Why I&rsquo;m cooling on MCPs</h3>
<p>Which brings me to my current stance and understanding of MCPs. I am not
that big of a fan of MCPs anymore and I think it boils down to 2 reasons.</p>
<p>The first one is that they consume so much of the context and if you have
a couple of them going then a huge chunk of the available context is
consumed by a bunch of tokens that potentially has no use for most of the
session. The second reason is that I think the use case for MCPs are not
necessarily aligned with how I use LLMs to do development. As I see it the
biggest advantage of MCP is that they work without needing a full linux
style sandbox, and they can work with much less capable models. They are
also useful for exposing a product&rsquo;s APIs in a uniform way so that the LLM
can learn about it and then potentially use that to create some small
tools and stop using that MCP later on to save tokens.</p>
<p>Another approach could be to put the MCP tools list, or just even the
script to start up MCP and running it, into a skill that gets loaded
when needed. That would get around the context pollution problem of MCPs,
if it works. I have not managed to get that work in a useful way yet.</p>
<h3 id="skills-and-subagents">Skills and subagents</h3>
<p>So far I have not played around that much with Skills in Claude Code
because I don&rsquo;t use Claude Code daily, but I have been applying the same
concept in my daily work and combined it with subagents. The results are
promising thus far. I find that these two abstractions complement each
other quite well actually.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier subagents are mainly a token context optimization
hack. They&rsquo;re a way for an agent to run a bunch of extra tools calls (e.g.
to investigate the source of a bug) without consuming many tokens in the
parent agent loop - the subagent gets its own loop, can use up to ~240,000
tokens exploring a problem and can then reply back up to the parent agent
with a short description of what it did or what it figured out.
A subagent might use one or more skills as part of running.
A skill might advise the main agent on how best to use subagents to solve
a problem.</p>
<h2 id="current-workflow">Current workflow</h2>
<p>After all this experimentation, I&rsquo;ve settled on what actually works.</p>
<p>My current workflow is a frankenstein of all the aforementioned
methodologies bundled together where I have discarded what I don&rsquo;t find
useful and kept what I have found works for me. Also to further drive home
the point that what I&rsquo;m doing and how I&rsquo;m working with these tools
probably will not work for you is that my workflow is based on how I
derive satisfaction when programming, for more detail and a thorough
explanation see this
<a href="/ai-and-software-engineering-the-conflict-within/">post</a>.</p>
<h3 id="my-actual-daily-process">My actual daily process</h3>
<p>My main serious workflow is that I create an index.md file that contains
small two sentence descriptions of files in a folder called agent_docs/
that contain useful information and small scripts in markdown files that
the agent can read when needed. While implementing something new that is
slightly bigger I use a planning / brainstorming agent that asks me
questions and helps me break down tasks into smaller items in a plan.md
that can be used to implement the feature by other agents. Then at the end
I have a review agent that reviews the code, usually using a different
model than the one that did the implementation because models are prone to
liking their own output. After these things I look at the code, test it,
tweak it and either keep it, if it&rsquo;s good enough, but more often than not
I use it as a starting point for my own exploration and implementation.</p>
<p>The most success I have had so far is super quick implementation of stuff
that has already been done in the codebase, such as writing pipelines to
move data. So many of the base components I have written myself and they
can just be glued together by the AI and it is a serious productivity
boost.</p>
<p>When just wanting to try out some quick stuff, or a couple of different
things I just one shot prompt the models and tell it to use the index.md
file to get something useful out. But these are almost always throw away
pieces of code that test some ideas out, just so I kind of know what ideas
I should pursue myself and explore.</p>
<p>This is a slight side note but the cost of generating code is so low right
now that I do really believe in re-writing code 3 times inspired by Steve
McConnell. Not for all use cases but for many I do currently re-write it
at least twice with the first iteration being done by AI.</p>
<p>I also use the deep research capabilities of Gemini quite a bit because I
find it&rsquo;s quite useful when I want to get a low resolution map of the
problem space I&rsquo;m in, for example the latest use was trying to understand
how oauth2-proxy is used in Kubernetes and how the flow of a request looks
like. I had zero experience or knowledge about this before hand. But with
deep research I was able to get a good set of resources and some base
knowledge that could then be validated against the sources used. It turned
out really good and really helped me get the implementation working and
understanding how it all worked. Not directly from the deep research
output but that was enough to show me what I needed to search further for.</p>
<h3 id="tools-and-resources">Tools and resources</h3>
<p>For transparency, here&rsquo;s my current stack:</p>
<ul>
<li>opencode, CLI tool for using LLMs. Open source Claude code pretty much.</li>
<li>Gemini pro, only using the deep research capability</li>
<li>z.ai, a super cheap LLM provider, I use it for access to GLM 4.6.
Unlimited usage for 45 dollars per quarter. This is my main model
currently</li>
<li>zen.ai a non-profit LLM provider, I use it to try out different models
at like 20 dollars a month. Been really liking kimi-k1.5 from here
recently.</li>
<li>GitHub copilot subscription, only using Claude 4.5 from here.</li>
<li>Different MCPs not that much anymore but still happens.</li>
<li>Custom subagents and /commands</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Where does this all go from here? I think we&rsquo;re still in the early days of
figuring out how to work with AI tools effectively. The tooling will get
better, models will improve, and some of the context hacks I&rsquo;m using now
will become unnecessary.</p>
<p>What won&rsquo;t change is the need to understand when and why you&rsquo;re using AI.
The developers who thrive will be those who learn to orchestrate these
tools effectively while maintaining ownership of their architectural
decisions and core implementations.</p>
<p>For now, I&rsquo;m sticking with my frankenstein workflow. It&rsquo;s messy, it&rsquo;s
personal, and it works for me. That&rsquo;s good enough.</p>
