      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me preface this post with the fact that&#xA;I was a huge macOS fanboy for a decade or so and only started feeling that the&#xA;OS was getting in my way a couple of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With today being the 34th birthday of Linux it made me reflect a bit on how I&#xA;have used it over the years. I started out using Ubuntu at University 12 years&#xA;ago for some intro labs and for learning how to navigate the filesystem with a&#xA;terminal. That experience was very meh, I thought the OS looked clunky and I was&#xA;not sold on using the terminal over a GUI, especially when compared to the sleek&#xA;and beautiful macOS UI. So this was an opinion that I held on to for a long&#xA;time, of course I was using Linux in the cloud for servers and even just running&#xA;stuff with docker and so on but that was it really.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
