      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before we get into the coding part of the series I think it would be beneficial&#xA;to give some background to what the ReAct loop is that we are going to make use&#xA;of to build this agent and also describing a bit how the code is going to look&#xA;like. This will not be that long to be fair because the basic loop is fairly&#xA;simple once you grok the ReAct loop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since I switched to Linux as my main OS and started building my own&#xA;tools, I&amp;rsquo;ve had this nagging feeling about the coding agents I use daily. I&#xA;understand the principles how LLMs work, how tool calling happens, the&#xA;general architecture. But there&amp;rsquo;s a difference between understanding the&#xA;concepts and truly knowing what&amp;rsquo;s happening in the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I saw someone on Hacker News compare building your own coding&#xA;agent to crafting your own lightsaber. That clicked. Just like a Jedi needs&#xA;to understand their weapon intimately, not just conceptually, I want to move&#xA;from theoretical understanding to practical mastery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
