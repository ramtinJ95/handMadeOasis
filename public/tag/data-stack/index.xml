      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately I have been thinking quite a bit about the question &amp;ldquo;What is a data&#xA;platform in its most basic form&amp;rdquo;. When I set out to answer this question my&#xA;first thought was that it&amp;rsquo;s not possible to answer this in a useful way. Reason&#xA;being that what a data platform is varies a lot depending on the company.&#xA;Basically, the data platform that a big tech company with 1000&amp;rsquo;s of engineers use&#xA;and a team with 100 engineers use will be wildly different. So I shifted my focus&#xA;from the tech and scale to capabilities. I think this is a good way of actually&#xA;making clear what a data platform is, by saying what it should be able to do at&#xA;the absolute minimum. This post provides the foundational framework, over the next few posts, we&amp;rsquo;ll dive deep into each layer with real implementation details and lessons learned. So the layers below are what I came up with based on&#xA;experience and my own opinions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
