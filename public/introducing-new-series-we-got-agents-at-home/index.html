  <p>Ever since I switched to Linux as my main OS and started building my own
tools, I&rsquo;ve had this nagging feeling about the coding agents I use daily. I
understand the principles how LLMs work, how tool calling happens, the
general architecture. But there&rsquo;s a difference between understanding the
concepts and truly knowing what&rsquo;s happening in the implementation.</p>
<p>A few days ago I saw someone on Hacker News compare building your own coding
agent to crafting your own lightsaber. That clicked. Just like a Jedi needs
to understand their weapon intimately, not just conceptually, I want to move
from theoretical understanding to practical mastery.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m building a coding agent from scratch. This series documents that
journey no frameworks, every line explained, all the features you&rsquo;d expect
(tool calling, subagents, MCPs, the works). I&rsquo;m calling it &ldquo;We got agents at
home&rdquo; because spoiler: there&rsquo;s no magic, just programming we can understand
deeply by building it ourselves.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-expect-from-this-series">What to expect from this series</h2>
<p>I will write a coding agent from scratch using no agent framework because
I&rsquo;m going to explain every line of code to the best of my ability so we know
what is going on at each step. At the end of the series I imagine our coding
agent will have the following features/capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tool calling</li>
<li>Slash commands</li>
<li>Running code in a safe way</li>
<li>Context management/ context pruning</li>
<li>Exploring caching strategies</li>
<li>Subagent being used by the primary agent</li>
<li>Ability to use MCPs</li>
<li>Possibility to read agent.md files to define different primary and subagents</li>
<li>Exploring different long term memory solutions</li>
</ul>
<p>At some point in this journey, probably pretty early on, we will have to
create a nice CLI or TUI using some kind of framework. But I&rsquo;m not yet sure
if that will be integrated into this series or if those parts will be
optional.</p>
<p>The cadence of posts will be at least one new entry to the series weekly.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h2>
<p>The build-it-yourself ethos isn&rsquo;t just about control. Mainly, it&rsquo;s about
understanding. I&rsquo;ve been on this kick of either building my own tooling or
having a deep understanding of what I use daily. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s part of
the &ldquo;culture&rdquo; of Linux or me maturing as a software engineer, but this has
become quite important to me.</p>
<p>To be clear, the idea isn&rsquo;t that we&rsquo;ll create something that can compete
with Claude Code or OpenCode et al. Rather, the purpose is to demystify and
bring clarity around what&rsquo;s going on under the hood. That&rsquo;s the reason for
the name, it comes from the &ldquo;we have x at home&rdquo; meme. My aim is to show that
there is no magic, it&rsquo;s all good ol&rsquo; programming still.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-coding-agents-side-quests">Beyond coding agents: side quests</h2>
<p>I will also explore creating and using agents for tasks that are not related
to coding. The reason for this is that I actually think that building agents
is a space that is bottlenecked by creativity, and I find this entire
problem space very interesting. It reminds me of creating small little games
when I had just learned the basics of programming and was starting to get
&ldquo;fluent&rdquo; with communicating with the computer.</p>
<p>One of the first non-coding agents I will try to build eventually is an agent
that helps organize notes and ideas and integrate them with my existing
personal wiki.</p>
<p>What I cannot create, I do not understand. Time to start creating.</p>
<p>The first post is live: <a href="/agent-at-home-part-1a/">Agent at Home Part 1a</a> - covering the conceptual foundation before we write any code.</p>
