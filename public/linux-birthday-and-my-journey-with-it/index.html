i was a huge MacOS fanboy for a decade or so and only started feeling that the

With today being the 34th birthday of Linux it made me reflect a bit over how i
have used it over the years. I started out using Ubuntu at University 12 years
ago for some intro labs and for learning how to navigate the filesystem with a
terminal. That experience was very meh, I thought the OS looked clunky and i was
not sold on using the terminal over a GUI, especially when compared to the sleek
and beautiful MacOS UI. So this was an opinion that I held on to for a long
time, of course I was using Linux in the cloud for servers and even just running
stuff with docker and so on but that was it really." />

  <p>Let me preface this coming post with the fact that
i was a huge MacOS fanboy for a decade or so and only started feeling that the
OS was getting in my way a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>With today being the 34th birthday of Linux it made me reflect a bit over how i
have used it over the years. I started out using Ubuntu at University 12 years
ago for some intro labs and for learning how to navigate the filesystem with a
terminal. That experience was very meh, I thought the OS looked clunky and i was
not sold on using the terminal over a GUI, especially when compared to the sleek
and beautiful MacOS UI. So this was an opinion that I held on to for a long
time, of course I was using Linux in the cloud for servers and even just running
stuff with docker and so on but that was it really.</p>
<p>Then around mid to late 2023, for some reason I really got into optimizing
and customizing my developer experience, but also just my interactions with my
computer. The best way I can describe it is like I started to not only think of
the computer as a tool to get things done with, but rather an extension of
myself somehow. At this point I was looking for something different, something
that would allow me to feel closer to the computer in a sense. Randomly I got
recommended (is it ever randomly though? I feel like the Youtube algorithm
somehow knows what I&rsquo;m really looking for, this has happened more than once) a
clip of ThePrimeagen just absolutely flying all over the screen, editing code,
compiling, looking at the result, back to the browser, back to the code, paste
here, paste there etc. I was just amazed and decided I want that for myself so i
started learning Neovim, tmux etc. Very slowly at first but as time passed I
started to gain quite a bit of confidence with the tools.</p>
<p>At this point in time I was still using MacOS as my daily driver, but now I was
starting to see the problems. Just how the OS is blocking you from doing what
you want and even on the &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; machines you cannot really do anything they dont
want you to do. I find MacOS to be quite an opinionated OS actually, and that is
super fine, but I started to not share those same opinions anymore slowly but
surely. My frustrations really reached a tipping point when i was trying to use
a proper window manager on MacOS, i choose to go with the yabai + skhd combo and
wow is the setup brittle. It feels like on every MacOS update something new
breaks or stops working. So i thought if this is already the case, and one of
the major points against a Linux desktop environment is that it can be prone to
breaking, then I&rsquo;m already in pain let me atleast have the freedom that comes
with Linux.</p>
<p>So I went back to Ubuntu and tried it again. It was again just okej, it was
better than the first time because i was super used to a terminal based workflow
and the tools i used for my job, Neovim, tmux, zsh, eza, zioxide, yazi etc where
the same but something was still missing. Then around a month ago I came across
an Arch Linux config package called Omarchy, from the famous programmer DHH.</p>
