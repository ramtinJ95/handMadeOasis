      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote a post a while ago about my current workflow when working with AI, my&#xA;initial skepticism and some brief mentions of the concept of recreational&#xA;programming. This post is going to be a continuation of the train of thought&#xA;presented in that previous post, but it will be a stand alone piece still. In&#xA;other words there is no need to have read the previous one to follow along in&#xA;this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Is a Data Platform</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately I have been thinking quite a bit about the question &amp;ldquo;What is a data&#xA;platform in its most basic form&amp;rdquo;. When I set out to answer this question my&#xA;first thought was that it&amp;rsquo;s not possible to answer this in a useful way. Reason&#xA;being that what a data platform is varies a lot depending on the company.&#xA;Basically, the data platform that a big tech company with 1000&amp;rsquo;s of engineers use&#xA;and a team with 100 engineers use will be wildly different. So I shifted my focus&#xA;from the tech and scale to capabilities. I think this is a good way of actually&#xA;making clear what a data platform is, by saying what it should be able to do at&#xA;the absolute minimum. This post provides the foundational framework, over the next few posts, we&amp;rsquo;ll dive deep into each layer with real implementation details and lessons learned. So the layers below are what I came up with based on&#xA;experience and my own opinions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Brain Dump: AI Assisted Workflows</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is just like a note or dump of everything I research on AI agents, MCP, and&#xA;other generative AI stuff. I think the correct phrase for it is a stream of&#xA;consciousness dump&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a kind of tier or ladder of sophistication that is slowly&#xA;getting shaped when it comes to AI assisted workflows, especially in relation to&#xA;software engineering. As I see it currently we have the use of online chat&#xA;interfaces, this is where you have chatGPT, Claude and company. At this point 3 years in,&#xA;this I think we have to admit has become table stakes pretty much. The next&#xA;level up is having an agent side by side your daily work. Here you have direct&#xA;access to the LLM and if you use a vscode fork like Cursor or any of their&#xA;competitors its usually just another pane on the right side of your code. This&#xA;is pretty nice, especially when you start to use it. It just feels so nice to&#xA;not have to leave your editor (personally i hated having to use these vs code&#xA;forks, and so glad the next level now exists), and just have the LLM have some&#xA;context around your code and so on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Linux&#39;s Birthday and My Journey With It</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me preface this post with the fact that&#xA;I was a huge macOS fanboy for a decade or so and only started feeling that the&#xA;OS was getting in my way a couple of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With today being the 34th birthday of Linux it made me reflect a bit on how I&#xA;have used it over the years. I started out using Ubuntu at University 12 years&#xA;ago for some intro labs and for learning how to navigate the filesystem with a&#xA;terminal. That experience was very meh, I thought the OS looked clunky and I was&#xA;not sold on using the terminal over a GUI, especially when compared to the sleek&#xA;and beautiful macOS UI. So this was an opinion that I held on to for a long&#xA;time, of course I was using Linux in the cloud for servers and even just running&#xA;stuff with docker and so on but that was it really.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
